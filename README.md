# gimbal_assist_SolidWorks
SolidWorks design for a gimbal assistive device to help linemen working from helicopter platform. 

AbstractThis project introduces a new design for the helicopter power line / transmission line inspection industry that is a first step in a series of product designs that will increase pilot and helicopter crew safety, and will significantly reduce liability and operating costs.  The design is a prototype solid model of a new gimbal assistant that will greatly aid the operatorâ€™s ability to get faster and more accurate readings of powerline couplings for long reach applications.  Safety features are integrated into the design to ensure that the helicopter is safe from rotor obstruction.  Considerations have been made for size, weight, cost, and producibility.  The SolidWorks Solid Model demonstrates the feasibility of the design and also provides production ready drawings for prototype manufacturing.  This started out as a school project for a CAD class but morphed into a real design for Summit Helicopter under the guidance of John Rodney Horn.
